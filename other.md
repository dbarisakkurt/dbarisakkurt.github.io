Here are random other things about me:

# RECOMMENDATIONS

### Tech Books:
- **Hackers: Heroes of the Computer Revolution:** A book about the early history of computer revolution. A thick (around 500 pages) but a very engaging book that became a classic.
- **Writing Interpreters in Go:** This book teaches you how to write your own programming language using Go. The code in the book is easy to understand. Even if I don't know Go language, I was able to follow the book easily. The book helps you implement lexer, parser, AST and interpretation without using a 3rd party library.
- **The Programmerâ€™s Brain:** This is a book that bridges the gap between cognitive science and software development. I liked the fact that the information in the book is backed by science.
- **Agile: The Good, The Bad and The Ugly:** A book about the agile by industry veteran Bertrand Meyer. Meyer explains the pros and cons of agile methods in this book. The book was published in 2014 at the peak of agile hype. That makes this book even more valuable, because Meyer shows us the the shortcomings of agile methods in his book, something many agile books failed to do so from that era.
- **A Philosophy of Software Design:** An amazing book that focuses on software design. The author talks about both more abstract things like how to design modules or hide information as well as more concrete things like writing comments and naming things. Examples are easy to understand, concepts are explained very clearly. A recommend book for both beginners as well as experts.
- **Hackers & Painters:** A collection of essays by Paul Graham. Some essays have good advice which I still remember. This was one of the first books talking about tech and computers that I read, when I was a university student. In those days (2007-2008), books of this sort were a rare find. So, it has a special place in my life.
- **How Computers Really Work** The book explains how a computer works by starting from binary logic. Chapters built on top of each other and the author explains circuits, memory, programming langauges, operating systems and the internet in order. The author Matthew Justice explains all the concepts in a clear and understandable way without skipping technical details that made me admire the book.
