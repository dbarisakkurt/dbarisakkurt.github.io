# TECH BOOKS

The list of tech books I have read and recommend everyone during my career. For the full list of books I have read, please see [my Goodreads profile](https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3388227-baris). This is a living list that I will update as I discover new good books.

### Hackers: Heroes of the Computer Revolution

<img style="float: right; width: 10%; margix:5px;" src="/assets/images/bookCovers/HeroesOfCompRev.jpg">

A book about the early history of computer revolution. A thick (around 500 pages) but very engaging book that became a classic. The book starts with the Tech Model Railroad Club in MIT and touches on subjects like free software, games, the Homebrew Computer Club etc. Understanding how the software industry evolved provides valuable new perspectives, which is why reading this book is important.

### Writing Interpreters in Go

<img style="float: right; width: 10%; margix:5px;" src="/assets/images/bookCovers/WritingIntInGo.png">

This book teaches you how to write your own programming language using Go in around 250 pages. The Go code in the book is easy to understand and supported with explanations. Even if I didn't know the Go language, I was able to follow the book easily. The book helps you implement lexer, parser, abstract syntax tree and interpretation without using a 3rd party library. It explains the concepts in a clear way. I recommend this book to those who are curious to invent their own programming language.

### The Programmer’s Brain

<img style="float: right; width: 10%; margix:5px;" src="/assets/images/bookCovers/ProgBrain.jpg">

This is a book that bridges the gap between cognitive science and software development. If you are wondering why a method that takes 8 parameters is difficult to understand or how to improve your code reading skills, this is the book to read. I liked the fact that the information is backed by science, something we often lack in other books that give recommendations.

### Agile: The Good, The Hype and The Ugly

<img style="float: right; width: 10%; margix:5px;" src="/assets/images/bookCovers/Agile.jpg">

This is a book about Agile by industry veteran Bertrand Meyer. In it, Meyer explains the pros and cons of agile methods. The book was published in 2014 at the peak of the Agile hype, which makes it especially valuable. Meyer highlights the shortcomings of agile methods and provides a critical analysis, something many other agile books from that era failed to do.

### A Philosophy of Software Design

<img style="float: right; width: 10%; margix:5px;" src="/assets/images/bookCovers/PhilOfSwDes.png">

This is an amazing, relatively short book that focuses on software design. The author talks about both more abstract concepts, like how to design modules, hide information, and use abstraction, as well as more concrete topics like writing comments, naming things, and testing. The examples are easy to understand, and the concepts are explained very clearly. It's a highly recommended book for both beginners and experts.

### Hackers & Painters

<img style="float: right; width: 10%; margix:5px;" src="/assets/images/bookCovers/HAndP.jpg">

This book has a collection of essays by Paul Graham. Some essays such as "how to make wealth" have very good advice which I still remember to this day. This was one of the first books about technology, products and computers that I read, when I was a university student. In those days (2007-2008), books like this were a rare find. So, it has a special place in my life.

### How Computers Really Work

<img style="float: right; width: 10%; margix:5px;" src="/assets/images/bookCovers/HowCompsReallyWork.jpg">

The book explains how a computer works by starting from binary logic. Chapters build on top of each other, and the author explains circuits, memory, programming languages, operating systems, and the internet in order. Matthew Justice explains all the concepts in a clear and understandable way without skipping technical details, which is why I admire this book. I recommend it to those who want to learn the big picture of how computers work.

### Working Effectively with Legacy Code

<img style="float: right; width: 10%; margix:5px;" src="/assets/images/bookCovers/WorkEffLegacyCode.jpg">

Let's face it. Most of us in the industry work in long-running old projects. A greenfield project is rare. Despite this, we have very few books that address this issue and Working Effectively with Legacy Code is one of those few books. The book gives concrete and pragmatic advice and explains different techniques to those who has to deal with legacy code and uses the mainstream languages such as Java and C++ to explain the concepts.
