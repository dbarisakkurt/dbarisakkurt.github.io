# DONATION

I prefer reading e-books to physical books. Lately, I started donating my old books to the schools in rural areas of Turkey and [my alma mater’s library](https://kutuphane.itu.edu.tr/en/home). See [this](https://divit.library.itu.edu.tr/search?/dD.+Bar{u0131}{u015F}+Akkurt+Ba{u011F}{u0131}{u015F}+Katalo{u011F}u/dd+baris+akkurt+bagis+katalogu/-3%2C-1%2C0%2CB/frameset&FF=dd+baris+akkurt+bagis+katalogu&1%2C1%2C) and [this](https://divit.library.itu.edu.tr/search?/dBar{u0131}{u015F}+Akkurt+Ba{u011F}{u0131}{u015F}+Katalo{u011F}u/dbaris+akkurt+bagis+katalogu/-3%2C-1%2C0%2CB/exact&FF=dbaris+akkurt+bagis+katalogu&1%2C2%2C) links for the books I donated to the my alma mater’s library.
