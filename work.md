I am Baris Akkurt. I specialize in back-end development with C# and .NET framework. You can read more about my work on [my LinkedIn profile](https://www.linkedin.com/in/dbarisakkurt/). Also, [my Github profile](https://github.com/dbarisakkurt) has a few toy projects that I worked on in the past.

I have 13+ years of professional experience at medium and large companies in 3 different countries: Turkey, Germany and Belgium. Things I do at work:
- Designing a solution for a problem
- Solving problems by writing code
- Debugging, performance analysis, memory analysis, maintenance of the code base
- Writing tests (unit testing, integration testing, property testing)
- Writing and reviewing documentation
- Reviewing code
- Collaboration with the teammates and colleagues

Here are the list of tools I have used during my career (and I still keep using some of them on a daily basis):
- **Programming languages:** C#, Python
- **Libraries and Frameworks:** .NET Framework, ASP.NET, Blazor, gRPC, Django
- **Testing:** NUnit, FsCheck
- **IDEs:** Visual Studio, PyCharm
- **Editors:** Visual Studio Code, Notepad++
- **Databases:** Sqlite, MS SQL Server
- **Version Control:** Git, TFS, SVN
- **Profiler:** dotTrace, dotMemory
- **Issue tracking:** Jira
- **Wiki:** Confluence, Mediawiki
- **Other:** Github, Gitlab, Jenkins, Postman, Crucible, Markdown, HTML

I have explored mobile development through personal projects using Swift, Xcode for iOS and Java, Android SDK and Android Studio for Android. However, those projects I developed were small and toy projects and some are available in [my github account](https://github.com/dbarisakkurt). Furthermore, I used C and C++ while pursing my computer engineering degree and I occasionally wrote some C++/CLI code in a previous role.
