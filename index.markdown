Welcome to my personal website! My name is Barış Akkurt (My full name is Dicle Baris Akkurt, Dicle Baris is my first name and Akkurt is my last name. My friends and family call me Baris.) I hold a BSc degree in computer engineering from Istanbul Technical University. I have been working as software engineer since 2013. I use .NET technology stack on a daily basis at work.

I was born and raised in [Mersin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mersin), a vibrant Mediterranean city in [Turkey](https://goturkiye.com/), where I completed my elementary and high school education. My interest in technology and problem-solving led me to [Istanbul](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Istanbul), where I pursued a bachelor's degree in [computer engineering](https://bm.itu.edu.tr/en) at the [Istanbul Technical University](https://www.itu.edu.tr/en/homepage). Since graduating, I have built a career as a software engineer. Starting in 2013, I have developed deep expertise in the product development using C# programming language and the .NET ecosystem.

In my free time, I read books, watch movies and TV shows, swim and travel. As a person born in a Mediterranean city, I have always liked swimming. Although, I do not live in my hometown now, I still go to swimming pools where I live. I find it relaxing and also it is beneficial for my health. Having visited abroad first time in 2014, I discovered that traveling is fun. It is exciting and broadens one’s horizons. Since then, I try to visit different countries and cities every year. So far I have visited only Europe, North America, North Africa and Indonesia, but look forward to visiting other continents. While at home, I spend my time reading books and watching movies and TV shows. Especially I like tech books and history/culture books. I read tech books because it is my profession and I enjoy learning new things. I read history and culture books because to be able to understand today, it is essential to know about the past.

I like getting to know new people, helping people, talking about tech and product development. If you have something to talk about or questions on anything, feel free to contact me. I'm always eager to discover interesting books, software, app or tool recommendations, interesting talks, essays or articles in software engineering and computer science. I'm also happy to meet in Belgium if you are in the area.
